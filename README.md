## Executive Summary
Career Guidance App is a cross-platform mobile application built with Flutter (Dart) and Firebase. It provides students with a unified platform to explore career paths, attempt quizzes, access resources (PDFs, videos, links), bookmark content, and submit feedback or testimonials. Administrators can manage careers, quizzes, resources, testimonials, and users via an admin dashboard.

## System Overview
- Frontend: Flutter (Dart) — single codebase for Android & iOS.
- Backend: Firebase (Authentication, Cloud Firestore, Cloud Storage). Optional Cloud Functions for automation.
- Role-based app: Student and Admin roles determine available features and UI flows.

## Features

## Getting Started (Developer Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Flutter SDK (stable channel)
- Android Studio or Visual Studio Code
- Dart SDK (comes with Flutter)
- Firebase account

### Local setup
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```
3. Configure Firebase:
- Create Firebase projects for dev/staging/production (recommended).
- Use `flutterfire configure` or add `google-services.json` (Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS) to the respective platforms.
- Ensure `firebase_options.dart` is present under `lib/` (generated by FlutterFire CLI).

4. Run the app (debug):
```bash
flutter run
```

## Firebase: Collections & Recommended Schema (summary)
- `users` { uid, name, email, role, profilePhotoUrl, createdAt }
- `careers` { id, title, description, category, skillsRequired, createdAt }
- `resources` { id, careerId, title, type, fileUrl, uploadedBy, createdAt }
- `quizzes` { id, title, careerId, questions[], createdAt }
- `quizResults` { id, quizId, userId, score, answers[], completedAt }
- `feedback` { id, userId, message, rating, createdAt }
- `testimonials` { id, userId, content, status, createdAt }


## Deployment
### Android
- Build release APK: `flutter build apk --release`
- Or build AAB: `flutter build appbundle`
- Follow Google Play Store policies and sign the app before submission.


### Backend
- Use separate Firebase projects for dev/staging/production.
- Enable billing if using Cloud Functions, backups, or high storage usage.
- Schedule Firestore backups (gcloud firestore export) if required.


## Deliverables
- Complete source code (Flutter project)
- Database setup & Firestore rules
- Release APK / App Bundle
- Project report and documentation (this README + appendices)
- Test data & QA report
- User guide with screenshots
- Demo video (.mp4)
